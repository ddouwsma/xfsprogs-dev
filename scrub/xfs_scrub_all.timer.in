Description=Periodic XFS Online Metadata Check for All Filesystems

# The xfs_scrub_all program records the last time that it performed a media
# scan in @pkg_state_dir@.  If this path is not writable, the program
# aborts and systemd records this as a failure.  Disable the timer if the path
# is not writable.  This should be an uncommon situation since most
# readonly-root systems set that up to be writable (and possibly volatile).
ConditionPathIsReadWrite=@pkg_state_dir@
